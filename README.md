# Linear Regression Model for Feature Selection
This code is written in Python and utilizes the scikit-learn library to perform feature selection using linear regression. The goal is to identify which combination of input parameters results in the highest accuracy for a given dataset.

## Getting Started
Before running this code, make sure you have installed the required packages such as numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn. You will also need to have a dataset ready to use for feature selection.

## Input
The input for this code is a list of input parameters, denoted by input_parameters, which will be used to perform feature selection.

## Output
The output of this code is the combination of input parameters that resulted in the highest accuracy, along with the corresponding accuracy value.

## How it works
This code creates a LinearRegression model and loops through every possible combination of input parameters. It fits the model on the training data using the current combination of input parameters, and then calculates the accuracy of the model using the same data. It stores the accuracy values for each combination of input parameters in param_score_arr1, which is a list of lists containing the parameter combination and its corresponding accuracy.

After iterating over all possible combinations, the code then finds the combination that resulted in the highest accuracy and prints it as output.

## Conclusion
This code can be useful in identifying which input parameters are most important for a given dataset, allowing for more accurate predictions when using machine learning models.
